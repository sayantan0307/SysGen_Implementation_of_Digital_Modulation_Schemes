# SysGen_Implementation_of_Digital_Modulation_Schemes

The repository contains Simulink models of prominent digital modulation schemes: ASK, FSK, PSK, DM, ADM and QPSK. The scehemes have been implemented using the Xilinx Blockset, for hardware co-simulation of the models. 

Software: MATLAB R2013a and Xilinx ISE (for System Generator usage).
